TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the source code a copy of this License along with the source code.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the source code or any portion of it, and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the source code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of **this License**.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These are only the basic terms of the GNU GPL. For the full text of the license, please see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>.
